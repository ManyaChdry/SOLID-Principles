# SOLID-Principles
SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles.

SOLID stands for:

    S - Single-responsiblity Principle
    O - Open-closed Principle
    L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    I - Interface Segregation Principle
    D - Dependency Inversion Principle

These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows
